# Zuma-Game
Created a game using only C# code without readymade functions.
This project was used to deploy graphic rules of 3d and 2d dimensions and apply mathemtical rules of moving and animating circles and frames.
The project was built entirely from scratch without any libraries other than the basic graphic libraries for drawing shapes.
